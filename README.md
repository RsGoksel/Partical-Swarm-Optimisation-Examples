Exemplary Guidance for Problems Solvable through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Particle Swarm Optimization is based on social information sharing between individuals. 
Each individual is called a particle, and the population of particles is called a swarm. Each particle adjusts its position towards the best position in the swarm.
It is a heuristic search algorithm that is used to find the optimal solution to a given problem.

You'll see visualization the optimizing steps in Basic PSO and how behaviour or the particles.
